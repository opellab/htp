            This ontology is designed with flexibility to accommodate both vertical and horizontal changes, reflecting the evolving nature of taxonomy. 
            It utilizes a dynamic taxonomy that supports the seamless integration of new categories and subcategories, avoiding a rigid subclass hierarchy. 
            The ontology employs properties such as `hasSuperspectra`, `hasSpectra`, `hasSubfactor`, `hasSyndrome`, `hasComponent`, `hasTrait`, `hasSymptom`, 
            and `hasDisorder` to define clear relationships and maintain hierarchical adaptability. Future updates may include adding new categories
            to reflect emerging research findings and evolving scientific insights. This design ensures that the ontology can easily incorporate 
            new taxonomic elements and relationships, thus supporting continuous enhancement and refinement.
